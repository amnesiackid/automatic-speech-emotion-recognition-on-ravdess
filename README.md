## Installation

This project includes three different models,

To deploy the baseline model and the Wav2Vec2 integrated model, please run this in terminal:

```bash
  conda env create -f ser_model.yml
```
This will install all required packages and dependencies with the correct versions.

Once the installation is complete, activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate ser_model
```

Fine_tune_distill_hubert_on_ravdess_data.ipynb is tested in [Google Colab](https://colab.google/), therefore we encourage you to run the notebook there. The first cell of the notebook will install all the needed libraries for you.
